First digital library in Mostar is storing Physical books and audio books.
Currently the library is working but it has certain limitations.
Every single item whether it is Physical book or Audio book are implementing all the items from the Library item.

Try to see throughout the classes how can you improove design of the library by only implementing members and methods that each item type needs.

Hint: ISP (Interface segregation principle)
Bonus points for effective code architecture with folders.
