This workshop is supposed to help participants to closer understand DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle).

Current project is all about payment and shipping and does not adapt to ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) and DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

Project has one route and that is /api/payment with two methods GET and POST
We will be using POST method to be checking if our payment and shipment is working.

Using postman send POST request to above stated route with Request Body JSON:

{  
  "Amount": ,
  "CardNumber": "",
  "Address": "",
  "City": "",
  "Country": ""  
}

Enter your values and see if the application works.
